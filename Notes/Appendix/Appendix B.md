# Appendix B 

* **sets** :- collection of distinguishable objects

* φ --> empty set.
* Z --> the set of integers
* R --> the set of real numbers
* N --> the set of natural numbers


# lows

* **Empty Low** :-
* A n φ = φ 
* A u φ = A

* **Idempotency :-** 
* A u A = A
* A u A = A

* **Commutative :-**
* "state that the order in which events are combined does not affect the probability of the outcome "
* A n B = B n A 
* A u B = A u B 

* **Associative :-**
* A n (B n C) = C n (B n A)
* A u (B u C) = C u (B u A)

* **Distributive :-**
*  A u (B n  C) = ( A u B ) n ( A u C)
*  A n (B u  C) = ( A n B ) u ( A n C)

* **Absorption :-**
* A n (A u B) = A
* A u (A n B) = A

* **DeMorgan’s :-**
* A - (B n C )= (A - B) u (A - C)
* A - (B u C )= (A - B) n (A - C)

************************************

* For any two finite sets A and B, we have the identity
* |A u B |= |A| + |B| - |A n B|
* |A u B | <= |A|+|B|

* if A and B is  disjoint , then |A n B |=0 ,and |A u B|=|A|+|B| 
,if A c B , then |A| <= |B|.

* **A finite set** of n elements is sometimes called an **n-set**
* **A 1-set** is called a
**singleton**. 
* **A subset of k** elements of a set is sometimes called a **k-subset**

**************************************

* **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B, denoted A  **X**  B, is the set of all ordered pairs

* A **X** B |=|A| **.** |B|  --> A and B are finite sets

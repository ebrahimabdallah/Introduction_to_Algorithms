# Analyzing algorithms 

* ***What is analyzing an algorithm?***
>  is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms

* ***What is Running Time?***
>  It is the time the algorithm needs in executing the function


* ***Worst case*** :-  maximum number of steps on input data of size,
running time of an algorithm gives us an upper bound on the
running time for any input,
 represented as  Big O(n) .
-----------------
* ***Average case*** :- averaged over all possible inputs,    
 represented as big-Theta Θ(n) .
-------------------------- 
* ***Best case*** :-  minimum number of steps on input data of size,
 running time of an algorithm gives us an lower bound on the
running time for any input,
  represented as Big Omega or Ω(n) .

***The Divide and Conquer*** (Divide && coquer && combine)
  * Divide 
  * conquer
  * combine


***in merge sort*** 
* divide array into to subsequence of N/2 
* conquer sort 2 subsequence
* combine Merge 2 sorted subsequence 
* run in o(n)


------------------------------
***Order of Growth*** 
>defines the amount of time taken by any program with respect to the size of the input.

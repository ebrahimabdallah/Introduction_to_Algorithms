# Notes of chapter three

## Topics 

* **what's Growth of Functions..?** 
    * The order of growth of the running time of an algorithm

*  an algorithm that is asymptotically more efficient will be the best choice
for all but very small inputs.


* **to remember** we can often describe the running time of an algorithm
merely by inspecting the algorithm’s overall structure

* O-notation provides an asymptotic upper bound  **and** , Ω notation
provides an asymptotic lower bound on a function

* **Asymptotic Notation** is used to describe the running time of an algorithm

* **the Fibonacci sequence** is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Individual numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

# Notes of chapter one 

## Topics 

* **algorithm** is a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output
* **algorithm** is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the
correct output. We say that a correct algorithm solves the given computational
problem

______

* **data structure** is a way to store
and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
----------
* **NP-complete problems**
    
    * **NP** On the set of problems that do not have an efficient solution algorithm, but it is easy to validate a solution
    
         * If you find a solution to one of the problems, it is can to solve all of them
         
   * **P** Problems have clear and effective algorithms and clear steps to solve them
------------------------
**Parallelism**
  * Execute many operations simultaneously
 
  * based on the principle that large problems can often be broken down into smaller ones to be solved in parallel at the same time
 to increase the number of processes made in the second
